            <h2>An intuitive website is good for business</h2>


            <div>
                An intuitive website is good for business for several reasons:

Improved User Experience: An intuitive website makes it easier for users to navigate, find information, and complete tasks. A positive user experience increases customer satisfaction and encourages repeat visits.

Higher Conversion Rates: When users can quickly and easily find what they need, they are more likely to convert, whether that means making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or filling out a contact form.

Reduced Bounce Rates: An intuitive website reduces the chances of users leaving your site immediately after arriving (bounce rate). This leads to increased engagement and more time spent on your site.

Competitive Advantage: In a competitive market, an intuitive website sets your business apart and positions you as a user-focused brand, increasing your chances of attracting and retaining customers.

Positive Brand Perception: A well-designed and intuitive website enhances your brand's credibility and reputation. Users are more likely to trust and engage with a website that provides a seamless experience.

Increased Customer Loyalty: Intuitive websites foster a sense of loyalty among customers. Satisfied users are more likely to return and recommend your business to others.

Better Search Engine Ranking: User experience is an important factor in search engine rankings. Search engines prioritize websites that offer a positive experience, leading to improved visibility in search results.

Mobile-Friendly: An intuitive website is often mobile-responsive, catering to the growing number of users accessing the web via smartphones and tablets. This expands your reach to a broader audience.

Cost-Effectiveness: An intuitive website reduces the need for customer support and assistance, as users can find what they need on their own. This can lead to cost savings for your business.

Adapting to User Needs: An intuitive website takes into account user preferences, feedback, and behavior, allowing you to continuously improve and optimize your online presence.

In summary, an intuitive website positively impacts various aspects of your business, from customer satisfaction and engagement to conversion rates and brand perception. It helps you stand out in a competitive market, build customer loyalty, and achieve your business goals effectively.

            <h2>Keeping the user-friendliness across device sizes</h2>
            <p>The goal of mobile responsiveness is to ensure that the content and layout of a website remain user-friendly and visually appealing across a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.</p>

            <h2>Fitting the display to the user context</h2>
            <p>I look at devices from the perspective of what the user wants to achieve, and make consequential adjustments:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Mobile users</b> love to check the content, and scan for key information, therefore the content should be restricted to the strict essential.</li>
                <li><b>Table users</b>  love to immerse themselves in an experience without becoming overly interactive, therefore the content should offer more possibilities while taking care not to overwhelm them.</li>
                <li><b>Desktop users</b> want the full experience, and have space for management, therefore the full content should be reveled to them</li>
            </ol>
