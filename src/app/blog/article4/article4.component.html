            <h2>Adapting the display to various screen sizes</h2>
            <p>Mobile responsiveness, also known as responsive web design, refers to the ability of a website to adapt and display correctly on various devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>Keeping the user-friendliness across device sizes</h2>
            <p>The goal of mobile responsiveness is to ensure that the content and layout of a website remain user-friendly and visually appealing across a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.</p>

            <br>

            <br>

            <h2>Fitting the display to the user context</h2>
            <p>I look at devices from the perspective of what the user wants to achieve, and make consequential adjustments:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Mobile users</b> love to check the content, and scan for key information, therefore the content should be restricted to the strict essential.</li>
                <li><b>Table users</b>  love to immerse themselves in an experience without becoming overly interactive, therefore the content should offer more possibilities while taking care not to overwhelm them.</li>
                <li><b>Desktop users</b> want the full experience, and have space for management, therefore the full content should be reveled to them</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Mobile responsiveness is excellent for business</h2>
            <p>I improve website speed in 6 powerful steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Images Optimization:</b> I make sure images are compressed and resized to reduce their file size without compromising quality.</li>
                <li><b>HTTP Requests Minimization:</b> I reduce the number of elements (e.g., images, scripts, stylesheets) on each page to minimize HTTP requests, and use techniques like <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-lazy-loading/" target="_blank">Lazy loading</a> to load only the most necessary elements on the page.</li>
                <li><b>Code Optimization:</b> I use efficient code and follow best practices to improve website performance. I also remove unnecessary characters and whitespace from code files (Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML) to reduce their size.</li>
                <li><b>Above-the-Fold Content Prioritization:</b> I make sure the essential parts of a webpage is loaded first, so users see meaningful content quickly.</li>
                <li><b>Browser Caching Enablement:</b> I use caching mechanisms (cookies or local storage) to store static resources on a user's device, reducing the need to fetch them from the server on subsequent visits.</li>
                <li><b>Fast Web Hosting Provider Selection:</b> Hosting providers play a significant role in website speed. I always recommend reputable hosting providers with fast hosting service.</li>
                <!-- <li><b>Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</b> CDNs distribute website content across multiple servers worldwide, delivering it from the nearest server to the user, which can improve load times.</li> -->
                <!-- <li><b>Test and Monitor Performance:</b> Regularly test website speed and performance using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, or WebPageTest. Monitor performance metrics and make necessary adjustments.</li> -->
            </ol>
