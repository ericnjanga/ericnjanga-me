            <h2>Adapting the display to various screen sizes</h2>
            <p>Mobile responsiveness, also known as responsive web design, refers to the ability of a website to adapt and display correctly on various devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>Keeping user-friendliness across device sizes</h2>
            <p>The goal of mobile responsiveness is to ensure that the content and layout of a website remain user-friendly and visually appealing across a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers.</p>

            <br>

            <br>

            <h2>Fitting the display to the user context</h2>
            <p>I look at devices from the perspective of what the user wants to achieve, and make consequential adjustments:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Mobile users</b> love to check the content, and scan for key information, therefore the content should be restricted to the strict essential.</li>
                <li><b>Table users</b>  love to immerse themselves in an experience without becoming overly interactive, therefore the content should offer more possibilities while taking care not to overwhelm them.</li>
                <li><b>Desktop users</b> want the full experience, and have space for management, therefore the full content should be revealed to them</li>
            </ol>
